Version
-------

These notes are for STINGER version 15.10

Notes
-----

- STINGER directory structure and CMakeLists.txt have changed to support parallel build
  - lib/ directory houses the STINGER libraries
  - src/ directory houses the supporting binaries
  - external/ directory houses external dependencies
  - Can now build with make -j8 after performing cmake in the build directory
- Prevent remapping of graph on each batch sent over protobuf (fixing a memory leak)
- STINGER management web interface merged in
  - Hosted under the util/management directory
  - Flask API merged with the management console flask API and is now in util/flask
  - Old STINGER web interface now in util/graph_explorer
- Flask API improvements
  - Fix for empty batches
  - Optimization on sending batches
  - Flask is fully aware of directedness and is consistent with STINGER
  - Added a Swagger UI documentation to the Flask API
  - Added requirements.txt for easy dependency installation (Use pip install -r requirements.txt)
- PageRank changes
  - A PageRank that works on a directed graph was added
  - A PageRank that works over a subset of vertices was added. A JSON RPC call was also added to call this method
- stinger_alg
  - Most algorithms are now in the lib/stinger_alg directory
  - Algorithms are now uniformly used between the client applications and the JSON RPC server
- netflow_stream
  - Bug fixes
- Adamic Adar
  - Bug fix to the calculation to now be right for undirected graphs
- Numerous whitespace fixes (removing tabs)
- Refactored array_to_json_monolithic to reduce code redundancy
- Added type filtering to JSON requests on get_data_array_*
- Betweenness Centrality
  - Uses a BFS style solving approach now that is compatible with directed graphs and has a near identical runtime to old version
- Changed the default STINGER to be 3/4 of the specified memory size
- Added a configuration file option to the server that uses libconfig
  - Can be used to specify number of vertices, edge types, memory size, etc.
  - Can pre-map edge type strings and vertex type strings
  - stinger_new_full and stinger_shared_new_full API changed to support a robust config parameter
- Traversal macros had several bugs that were squashed
- Updated Readme.md to reference config file changes
- Added Testing infrastructure
  - Using googletest for tests
  - Added rule to CMake for `make check` that runs all unit tests
  - Updated travis.yml to automatically run make check on any new PRs
- travis.yml
  - Fixed travis to run in a docker container allowing for faster CI tests
