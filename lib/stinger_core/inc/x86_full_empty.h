/* x86 Emulation of Full Empty Bits Using atomic check-and-swap.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - Using these functions means that the MARKER value defined 
 *   below must be reserved in your application and CANNOT be 
 *   considered a normal value.  Feel free to change the value to
 *   suit your application.
 * - Do not compile this file with optimization.  There are loops
 *   that do not make sense in a serial context.  The compiler will
 *   optimize them out.
 * - Improper use of these functions can and will result in deadlock.
